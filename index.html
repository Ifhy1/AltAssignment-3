        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My name is Ify, and I am from Nigeria. I am currently studying at the <strong>University of the People</strong>, where I am pursuing my degree with a focus on technology and innovation. Alongside my university studies, I am also enrolled in the <strong>AltSchool Africa Cloud Engineering Diploma</strong> program, where I am gaining hands-on experience in cloud computing, DevOps practices, and modern infrastructure management.
<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am passionate about technology, personal growth, and helping others. I thrive on learning new skills, solving problems, and collaborating with diverse teams. My interests span digital transformation, scalable systems, and using technology as a tool for positive social impact.
    
          
          Beyond academics, I am committed to community development, mentorship, and continuous self-improvement. My long-term goal is to build a meaningful career in the tech industry where I can combine my technical expertise with my passion for empowering people and organizations to succeed.

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy reading books to broaden my knowledge and gain new perspectives, singing as a creative outlet that uplifts my mood, and coding to sharpen my problem-solving and technical skills. Listening to music helps me relax and spark fresh ideas, while exercising at the gym and swimming keep me healthy, disciplined, and energized.
          I also value spending time with friends, as it strengthens my social connections and enriches my sense of community.

          My aspiration in life is to become a highly skilled software developer who leverages technology to design innovative, practical solutions that improve lives and empower communities. I am equally passionate about inspiring others to embrace education,
           develop their skills, and confidently pursue their passions so they too can create meaningful change.
